# NNSS_SeismicAnalysis
***DISCLAIMER: This was a student lead project attempting to solve a research problem provided by the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). This does not provide a full proof analysis and should only be used to demonstrate the coding ability of the team. 

# Objective
Provide a method of differentiating natural seismic events from non-natural seismic events. Natural seismic events would be any kind of earthquake. A non-natural seismic event could be anything from animals walking near the sensor, mining demolitions to nuclear weapons tests. The end game would be to identify if weapons testing is occuring around the world and if possible to identify the location of these tests. However, this project attempts to just identify if the events are natural or non-natural.
